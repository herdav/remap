# remap

Input for the "[Enzyklopädie_Emmenbrücke](http://enzyklopaedie-emmenbruecke.ch/)" IDA-Project [@Hochschule-Luzern](https://github.com/Hochschule-Luzern).

The work «remap» deals with the processing of data and the aesthetics of statistical graphics. A satellite image of Emmen and the news feeds of central Switzerland of Swiss radio and television (SRF) and the Lucerne newspaper serve as raw data. A custom software converts this data into an animation graphic. The work «remap» doesn’t transport real facts, but produces the appearance of authenticity. Expectations, which are posed on the interpretation of data, could so be disturbed.

A virtual wanderer looking on the map for fictitious way points, shown as circular areas. Each way point exerts an attractive force on the wanderer, and a repulsive force from a certain distance – like the gravitational forces in the universe. Only these forces move the wanderer. Each exploration of a way point let this specific point grow. The growth depends on the duration of the exploration and the number of selected headlines from the news feeds. In addition, all way points are linked together and share the same resource. This means that the growth of a way point reduces the growth of all others – the resource is always distributed to all the way points. The path will be continuously recorded – the map condenses with time. Growth is thus interpreted as the accumulation of lines and circles.

With each new program start, a unique map is created – a map with a uniform structure or with areas of increased concentration.
